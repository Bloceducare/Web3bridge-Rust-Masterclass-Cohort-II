# Topic: User Input

## Requirements

- Verify user input against pre-defined keywords.
- The keywords represent possible power options for a computer:
  - Off
  - Sleep
  - Reboot
  - Shutdown
  - Hibernate
- If the user enters one of the keywords, print a message to the console indicating which action will be taken.
  - **Example:** If the user types `"shutdown"`, display a message such as **"shutting down"**.
- If the entered keyword does not exist, display an appropriate error message.

## Notes

- Use an `enum` to store the possible power states.
- Use a function with a `match` expression to print out the power messages.
  - The function should accept the enum as an input.
- Use a `match` expression to convert the user input into the power state enum.
- The program should be **case-insensitive**.
